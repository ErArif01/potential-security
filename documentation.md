## Introduction

  The process for reviewing documentation PRs is slightly different from
  [the general process for reviewing code PRs](https://github.com/kata-containers/bloob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reviewsPR-Review-Guide.md)
  This document explains the differences.

## The Documentation Team

  The Documentation Team is responsible for carrying out a full documentation
  review of a PRs containing documentation changes. Such a review includes
  checking the grammer, structure, consistency, and typographical correctness of 
  the documentation changes.

  The following GitHub team lists the users who are members of the Documentation Team:
  - https://github.com/orgs/kata-containers/teams/documentation/members

## Default Document review process

[Project maintainers](https://github.com/kata-containers/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#project-maintainers)

If a Documentation Team review is required, the `CODEOWNERS` configuration will
apply and the PR will be blocked until the required number of acks are obtained for the documentation changes.
